# luds-delphi-plus

As a seasoned Delphi developer, I thought I'd share here some snippets of code I built (and used) over the years. It is no easy feat finding sample codes especially in a language that is not very commonly used. Most, if not all, code snippets here are of Delphi 2006.
I don't take credit for all the code snippets I publish so I try my best to give where credit is due. Most of them I wrote myself and some are a collection of snippets I researched from the web to build a common solution.
